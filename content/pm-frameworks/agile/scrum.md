# Scrum Framework

## Quick Overview

Scrum is an agile framework for managing work in fixed-length iterations (sprints). It emphasizes transparency, inspection, and adaptation through defined roles, events, and artifacts.

## Core Components

### Roles
- **Product Owner**: Defines what to build, prioritizes backlog
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates process, removes impediments
- **Development Team**: Builds the product

### Events (Ceremonies)
- **Sprint**: Time-boxed iteration (1-4 weeks)
- **Sprint Planning**: Define sprint goal and backlog
- **Daily Scrum**: 15-min sync on progress/blockers
- **Sprint Review**: Demo completed work
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflect and improve process

### Artifacts
- **Product Backlog**: Prioritized list of all work
- **Sprint Backlog**: Work committed for current sprint
- **Increment**: Potentially shippable product at sprint end
