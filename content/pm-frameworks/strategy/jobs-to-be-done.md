# Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

## Quick Overview

JTBD focuses on the underlying job users are trying to accomplish, not the solution they're using. Users "hire" products to get jobs done. Understanding the job reveals opportunities beyond current solutions.

## Core Concept

**"People don't want a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole."**
- Theodore Levitt

Even deeper: They want to hang a picture. Even deeper: They want to make their home feel personal.

## Job Statement Format

**When I [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome].**

Example: "When I'm preparing for a stakeholder meeting, I want to quickly summarize project progress, so I can answer questions confidently."

## When to Use

- Understanding user needs at a fundamental level
- Finding innovation opportunities beyond incremental improvements
- Validating whether a feature addresses a real job
- Competitive analysis beyond feature comparison

## Key Questions

- What job is the user hiring your product for?
- What alternatives do they use for this job?
- What's the context when this job arises?
- What outcomes define success for this job?
