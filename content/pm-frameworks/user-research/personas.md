# User Personas

## Quick Overview

User personas are fictional, generalized representations of your ideal customers. They help teams understand user needs, behaviors, and goals to make better product decisions.

## Key Components of a Persona

- **Demographics**: Age, role, experience level
- **Goals**: What they're trying to achieve
- **Pain Points**: Frustrations and challenges
- **Behaviors**: How they work, tools they use
- **Motivations**: What drives their decisions
- **Context**: Environment and constraints

## Good Persona Characteristics

✅ Based on real research (interviews, data)
✅ Specific enough to guide decisions
✅ Focused on goals and behaviors, not just demographics
✅ Regularly validated and updated

## Common Mistakes

❌ Creating from assumptions, not research
❌ Too many personas (3-5 is usually enough)
❌ Focusing on demographics over behaviors
❌ Static documents that become outdated

## When to Use

- Feature prioritization decisions
- UI/UX design choices
- Marketing messaging
- Roadmap planning
- Stakeholder communication

## Key Questions

- Who are we building this for?
- What problem does this solve for them?
- How does this fit their workflow?
- Would [persona name] use this?
