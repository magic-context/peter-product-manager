# RICE Scoring Framework

## Quick Overview

RICE is a prioritization framework that scores features based on four factors: Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort. It produces a numerical score that helps compare different initiatives objectively.

## The Formula

**RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

## The Four Factors

**Reach**: How many users will this affect in a given time period?
- Measured in: Number of users per quarter

**Impact**: How much will this move the needle for those users?
- Scale: 3 = massive, 2 = high, 1 = medium, 0.5 = low, 0.25 = minimal

**Confidence**: How sure are you about these estimates?
- Scale: 100% = high confidence, 80% = medium, 50% = low

**Effort**: How much work is required?
- Measured in: Person-months

## When to Use

- Comparing features with different characteristics
- Need objective scoring for stakeholder discussions
- Want to reduce bias in prioritization decisions
