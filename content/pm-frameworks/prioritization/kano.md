# Kano Model

## Quick Overview

The Kano Model categorizes features based on how they affect customer satisfaction. It helps identify which features are essential, which delight users, and which have diminishing returns.

## Feature Categories

**Must-Have (Basic)**: Features users expect. Their absence causes dissatisfaction, but their presence doesn't increase satisfaction.
- Example: Login functionality in an app

**Performance (Linear)**: More is better. Satisfaction increases proportionally with functionality.
- Example: Faster loading times

**Delighters (Attractive)**: Unexpected features that create disproportionate satisfaction when present.
- Example: Personalized recommendations

**Indifferent**: Features users don't care about either way.
- Example: Backend technology choices (usually)

**Reverse**: Features that actually decrease satisfaction for some users.
- Example: Forced tutorials for expert users

## When to Use

- Understanding what features matter most to users
- Balancing innovation with table-stakes features
- Identifying opportunities for differentiation
- User research and feature validation

## Key Insight

Features move categories over time. Today's delighter becomes tomorrow's must-have.
