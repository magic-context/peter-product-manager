# User Stories Directory

This folder contains detailed specifications for each user story in the sprint.

## Structure

One file per user story:

```
user-stories/
├── us-001-user-login.md
├── us-002-password-reset.md
├── us-003-session-management.md
```

## Creating a User Story File

1. Copy `templates/user_story_details.md`
2. Name it with story ID: `us-001-brief-description.md`
3. Fill in all sections:
   - User story statement
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Technical details
   - Definition of done
   - Test scenarios

## Naming Convention

`us-[number]-[brief-description].md`

Examples:
- `us-001-user-authentication.md`
- `us-002-dashboard-widget.md`
- `us-003-email-notifications.md`

## Why Detailed Stories Matter

- Clear acceptance criteria prevent scope creep
- Technical notes reduce development questions
- Test scenarios ensure quality coverage
- Decision log preserves context

*Each user story file is the complete specification for that piece of work.*
