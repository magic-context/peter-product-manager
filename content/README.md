# Product Management Specialist

Your AI partner that remembers your product context, maintains strategic alignment, and helps you focus on what matters most.

## The Problem This Solves

Every PM knows this pain: AI is incredibly powerful for research, planning, and problem-solving, but each session starts from scratch. You re-explain your product, your users, your priorities—again. The accumulated context that would make AI truly valuable evaporates between sessions.

**This specialist changes that.**

## How It Works

Your Product Management Specialist maintains a hierarchical memory structure:

1. **Product & Company Context** - Vision, objectives, priorities that rarely change
2. **Projects** - Active initiatives with goals and stakeholders
3. **Phases & Sprints** - Breakdown of work with timelines
4. **User Stories** - Detailed specifications and acceptance criteria
5. **Product Documents** - PRDs, research findings, decision rationale

Every conversation builds on this context. The AI knows your product, your priorities, and your past decisions.

## Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Your Product Context
Start by documenting your product foundation:
- `product-context/company.md` - Your company and its mission
- `product-context/product-vision.md` - What you're building and why
- `product-context/core-objectives.md` - Key goals you're driving toward
- `product-context/roadmap.md` - High-level product direction
- `product-context/product-priority.md` - What matters most right now

### 2. Add Your Projects
For each active project, create a folder in `projects/`:
- Project overview with goals and success metrics
- Phases with milestones
- Sprints with user stories

### 3. Use Templates
Templates ensure consistency:
- `templates/product_overview.md` - Structure for new projects
- `templates/user_story_details.md` - Complete user story format
- `templates/sprint_plan.md` - Sprint planning structure
- `templates/sprint_details.md` - Sprint tracking format

### 4. Reference Frameworks (As Needed)
Background material in `pm-frameworks/` when you want to apply:
- Prioritization frameworks (RICE, KANO, etc.)
- Strategy frameworks (Jobs-to-be-Done, North Star, etc.)
- User research methodologies
- Agile approaches

## What Makes This Different

**Session Continuity**: Return tomorrow and pick up exactly where you left off. No re-explaining.

**Strategic Alignment**: Every task discussion happens in the context of your product vision and priorities.

**Focus Amplification**: AI can help prioritize because it knows your full context.

**Knowledge Compounding**: Each session adds to your product's institutional knowledge.

## Example Interactions

**Before (Generic AI):**
> "I need to write a PRD for user authentication"
> AI: "Here's a generic PRD template..."

**After (With This Specialist):**
> "I need to write a PRD for user authentication"
> AI: "Based on your product context, user authentication is part of the Security & Trust project in Phase 2. Your core objective of 'enterprise readiness' suggests we should emphasize SSO and audit logging. Looking at your user segments, the admin persona will need role-based access controls. Should I draft a PRD that aligns with these priorities and your previous authentication decisions from the mobile app project?"

## Getting Started

1. Read `ai-instructions/getting_started.md` for initial setup guidance
2. Populate your `product-context/` files
3. Add your first project
4. Start working—your context accumulates from here
