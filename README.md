# Peter - Product Management Specialist

AI specialist that maintains persistent product context, helping PMs focus on high-impact work through structured workspace organization.

## What This Solves

Product Managers face constant context loss when using AI tools. Each session starts fresh - you re-explain your product, users, and priorities again and again. This specialist maintains persistent memory of:

- Product vision and company context
- Active projects with goals and metrics
- Sprint-level details and user stories
- Past decisions and their rationale

Every conversation builds on previous knowledge, making AI assistance genuinely valuable over time.

## Key Features

- **Session Continuity** - Never re-explain your product context
- **Hierarchical Memory** - From product vision down to sprint tasks
- **Strategic Alignment** - Every task connects to broader objectives
- **Focus Amplification** - AI helps prioritize based on full context
- **Decision Consistency** - Past rationale informs future decisions
