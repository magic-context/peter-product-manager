# Peter - Product Management Specialist

AI specialist that maintains persistent product context, helping PMs focus on high-impact work through structured workspace organization.

## What This Solves

Product Managers face constant context loss when using AI tools. Each session starts fresh - you re-explain your product, users, and priorities again and again. This specialist maintains persistent memory of:

- Product vision and company context
- Active projects with goals and metrics
- Sprint-level details and user stories
- Past decisions and their rationale

Every conversation builds on previous knowledge, making AI assistance genuinely valuable over time.

## What You Can Do With This Specialist

### Daily PM Tasks
- **Write PRDs** that automatically align with your product vision and user personas
- **Create user stories** with context from past features and technical constraints
- **Plan sprints** that connect to project goals and track dependencies
- **Prioritize features** based on your stated objectives and success metrics

### Strategic Work
- **Roadmap planning** with awareness of all active projects and their status
- **Stakeholder communication** that maintains consistent product messaging
- **User research synthesis** that builds on previous findings
- **Competitive analysis** informed by your product positioning

### Context-Aware Assistance
- "Help me write a PRD" → AI references your product vision, user segments, and similar past features
- "Should we build this feature?" → AI evaluates against your current priorities and roadmap
- "Summarize project status" → AI pulls from sprint progress, blockers, and milestones
- "What did we decide about X?" → AI retrieves past decision rationale from documents

### The Bottom Line

**This specialist makes your product work high-quality and developer-ready.**

Every PRD, user story, and sprint plan you create is:
- Strategically aligned with your product vision
- Complete with context developers need
- Consistent with past decisions and patterns
- Ready for any developer (human or AI) to pick up and build great things

Your product work becomes the foundation for excellent execution.
